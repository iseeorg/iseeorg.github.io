Emacs tend to provide a good support for functional programming languages. Indeed, many FP language community exclusively use Emacs and give only first-party IDE supports to Emacs, such as Coq, Agda, Standard ML, Clojure, etc.

For the purpose of programming Coq with Proof General, I started to try with Emacs. I quickly found Spacemacs a good alternatives for me...someone had get used to Vim keybindings and want to get some thing useful ASAP w/o configuring a long list as my `.vimrc`.

Though the overall experience is pretty smooth, many quirks about Spacemacs are always being forgotten and had to look up again and again, so I decided to open a note for some specific "workflow" that I often used.

Yes this is more like a note publishing online for the purpose of "on-demand accessible". So don't expect good writing anyways.
